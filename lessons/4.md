# Lesson 4 - Writing your first test

Have your heard of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io), the unit testing library?

So, Protractor uses Jasmine as its default testing library, which means that the structure and syntax are basically the same.

First, you start a test suite, which uses the `describe()` function.

The `describe()` function receives a string as its first argument (e.g., `'my app'`) and a callback function as its second argument.

Inside of the `describe`'s callback function, tests are written in `it()` functions.

Similar to the `describe()` function, `it()` functions also receive a string as its first argument (e.g., `'test login with success'`) and a callback function as its second argument.

Then, the test logic is written inside of it's callback function.

## Exersice

Inside of the `specs/login.spec.js` file, create the basic structure to test the successful login scenario.

üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Here's a hint.

```js
// specs/login.spec.js

describe('Login', function() {
  it('logs in successfully', function() {

  })
})
```

Go to the terminal on this project's root directory and run `npx webdriver-manager update && npx protractor conf.js`.

```sh
Started
.

```

Tada! üéâ You have your first passing test!

Yeah, I know there's no test implemented yet, but it feels good to see it pass. Don't you feel that?

Alright, now you need to learn a few of the Protractor functionalities.

First, to visit a web page by its relative URL (since we already have the `baseUrl` defined in the config file), Protractor uses `browser.get('/some-relative-url')`.

Secondly, to locate HTML elements, Protractor can use a few strategies. Let's learn some of them.

```js
const iAmATextInputWithAnId = element(by.id('my-id'))
const iAmAnElementWithAClass = element(by.className('some-class'))
const iAmASubmitButton = element(by.css('button[type="submit"]'))
const iAmAHeadingWithASpecificText = element(by.cssContainingText('h1', 'I am a heading, yay!'))
```

Thirdly, to interact with the located elements, Protractor has many different methods. Let's explore a couple of them.

```js
// This is how Protractor simulates a user typing in a text input field (or a text area)
iAmATextInputWiId.sendKeys('Hi!')

// And this is how Protractor clicks on elements such as buttons, links, etc.
iAmASubmitButton.click()
```

It's your turn.

Go to `https://notes-serverless-app.com/signup` and manually create an account to use the created user for the `logs in successfully` test.

Then, implement the test's logic so that it will visit the `/login` relative URL, it will locate the right elements, and it will fill the form and submit.

Finally, run the test (`npx protractor conf.js`).

A test is a not a test if it's making no assertion.

After logging in, we need to assert (somehow) that the user is logged in.

Time to learn how to run a simple assertion with Protractor.

```js
const iAmAHeading = element(by.css('h1'))

expect(iAmAHeading.getText()).toContain('Some text that should be there')
```

Time out. It's you again!

Let's test that after logging in, a heading with the `Your Notes` text is displayed.

Hrm, it didn't work?

This is the error that showed up to me after running the test.

```sh
Started
F

Failures:
1) Login logs in successfully
  Message:
    Failed: No element found using locator: by.cssContainingText("h1", "Your Notes")
  Stack:
    NoSuchElementError: No element found using locator: by.cssContainingText("h1", "Your Notes")
```

Well, we made some progress, but there's one last thing to learn on this lesson.

When testing web applications with Protractor, sometimes you'll need to tell it to wait for certain conditon to happen before moving on.

Meet [`protractor.ExpectedConditions`](http://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ProtractorExpectedConditions).

> `protractor.ExpectedConditions` represents a library of canned expected conditions that are useful for Protractor, **especially when dealing with non-angular apps**.

> Each condition returns a function that evaluates to a promise. You may mix multiple conditions using `and`, `or`, and/or `not`. You may also mix these conditions with any other conditions that you write.

**Source:** http://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ProtractorExpectedConditions.

Let me try to make it easier to understand it.

Right after filling the form and submitting it, the application makes a request. If it succeeds, it redirects the user to a logged in page, with a 'Your Notes' heading.

The problem is that we're trying to run an assertion (`expect(yourNotesHeading.isDisplayed()).toBe(true)`) before the request is finished and the redirect happens.

That's when `protractor.ExpectedConditions` comes for our rescue! ü¶∏üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is an example of how to use it.

```js
const EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions

describe('Login', function() {
  it('logs in successfully', function() {
    // ... all previous logic is here

    const yourNotesHeading = element(by.cssContainingText('h1', 'Your Notes'))

    browser.wait(EC.visibilityOf(yourNotesHeading), 5000)

    expect(yourNotesHeading.isDisplayed()).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

There we go.

We're defining the heading element.

Then, we're telling the `browser` to `.wait` for a maximum of `5000` milliseconds (5 seconds) on an expected condition to evaluate to `true` (`EC.visibilityOf(yourNotesHeading)`.)

Finally, we're running the assertion that the heading is displayed.

Try to use the above example and run the test (`npx protractor conf.js`)

```sh
Started
.

```

Yay! The test is passing again (and now it's for real.)
