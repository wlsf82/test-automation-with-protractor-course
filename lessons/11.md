# Lesson 11 - Headless testing

Running tests in headful mode is very useful for debugging test failures or for demonstrations.

But the true value of test automation is to run them on every application change to have quick feedback when we break things.

To do that, we need to run tests on continuous integration servers, which usually don't have a display to run tests in headful mode.

Luckily, modern web browsers such a Chrome and Firefox provide us with the ability to run them in headless mode.

To configure Protractor for running tests in headless mode, we set some capabilities into it (see below.)

```js
// chrome.conf.js

module.config.exports = {
  capabilities: {
    browserName: 'chrome',
    chromeOptions: {
      args: ['--headless']
    }
  }
}

```

Or

```js
// firefox.conf.js

module.config.exports = {
  capabilities: {
    browserName: 'firefox',
    'moz:firefoxOptions': {
      args: ['--headless']
    }
  }
}

```

## Exercise

Configure Protractor to run tests in both headful and headless modes for Chrome and Firefox browsers.

What if we had npm scripts to run our tests in all different configurations?

That would be awesome, don't you think?

In the `package.json` file, there's a `scripts` property with a pre-defined `test` script.

> 🧙🏻 Besides helping us manage dependencies, the `package.json` file allows us to define as many scripts as we want. So, we can have`npm run [some-script]` shortcuts that run more complex commands for us. For example, `npx protractor config/chromeHeadlss.js` could be `npm run test:chrome:ci` instead.

Your turn.

Update the `package.json` file with the following test scripts:

* `test:chrome`
* `test:chrome:ci`
* `test:firefox`
* `test:firefox:ci`

> Remember to run all the scripts before moving on to the next exercise, and make sure they're working properly.

`package.json` also allows us to define a `pretest` script.

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ Hrm, that could be useful for updating the `webdriver-manager`!

It's you again.

Update the `package.json` file with a `pretest` script that runs `webdriver-manager update`.

Easy ha?
