# Lesson 9 - Meet the Page Objects pattern

When writing graphical user interface tests, it's a good practice to separate responsibilities.

Test files (`*.spec.js`) should be responsible for describing how the application behaves in different scenarios. By looking to them, you should understand what are the pre-conditions for the tests to run (`beforeEach()`); what actions every test performs (e.g., `login()`, or `helper.click(logoutLink)`); and last but not least, what are the expected results for each scenario (e.g., `expect(alertDialog.getText()).toEqual('User does not exist.')`.)

Anything else from the above-list is a distraction. Test cases are specifications of the application behaviors in different situations. This is why we suffix them `.spec`.

Going back to our existing tests, I can see at least two major distractions. They are:

* The definitions of elements
* The `login` function

What if we could have them on a different module, called `page`? 📃

Well, we actually can.

Simplifying, Page Objects are an abstraction used in test automation, where we define elements that could be present on a web page, and methods (which are actions that we could perform if we were using such page.)

Going in a functional approach, a sample Page Object could be defined as follows.

```js
// page-objects/sample.js

const helper = require('protractor-helper')

const nameField = element(by.id('name'))
const emailField = element(by.id('email'))
const messageField = element(by.id('message'))
const submitButton = element(by.css('button[type="submit"]'))
const thankYouHeading = element(by.className('thanks'))

function sendMessage(name, email, message) {
  helper.fillFieldWithText(nameField, name)
  helper.fillFieldWithText(emailField, email)
  helper.fillFieldWithText(messageField, message)
  helper.click(submitButton)
}

module.exports = {
  nameField,
  emailField,
  messageField,
  submitButton,
  thankYouHeading,
  sendMessage
}

```

Then, a test could simply require such a page, and use all of its elements and methods, as needed (see an example below.)

```js
// specs/sample.spec.js

const helper = require('protractor-helper')

const page = require('../page-objects/sample.js')

describe('Messages sample app', () => {
  beforeEach(() => browser.get('/messages'))

  it('successfully sends a message', () => {
    page.sendMessage(
      'John',
      'johndoe@example.com',
      'Hi, this is a test message'
    )

    helper.waitForElementVisibility(page.thankYouHeading)
  })
})
```

The test is mostly concerned with exactly what it should be doing. TESTING! On the other hand, the Page Object deals with locating elements, and defining ways (functions) for interacting with multiple elements at the same time.

Enough talking. 🤐

## Exercise

1. At the same level of the `specs/` directory, create a `page-objects/` directory
2. Inside of it, create an `index.js` file
3. Move all elements' definitions from the `specs/login.spec.js` file into the `page-objects/index.js` file.
4. Move the `login` function too
5. Export all elements and the `login` function as attributes of an object
6. Finally, import the newly created page into the test file (`const page = require('../page-objects')`) and refactor all tests to use it.

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ Remember to require `protractor-helper` inside of the Page Object.
