# Lesson 8 - Testing alternative paths

After testing the most important use case of a feature (e.g., testing a successful login of a login page), it's time to test its alternative paths.

Yeah, alternate path tests exist to ensure that our application works even when users do something unnexpected (and we know they do weird stuff, don't we?)

## Exercise

A behavior of the login page is that it only enables the 'Login' button after both the 'Email' and 'Password' input fields are filled.

It's your time to make sure this behavior is being tested.

But first, let me introduce you another kind of assertion that Protractor allows us to run.

### Meet the `getAttribute` method

This method schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element.

**Source:** http://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=webdriver.WebElement.prototype.getAttribute

Let's imagine that you need to test if certain anchor element has a `role` attribute with the value of `button`.

This is a way you could do it with Protractor.

```js
const myAnchorThatBehavesAsAButton = element(by.css('a .button'))

expect(myAnchorThatBehavesAsAButton.getAttribute('role')).toContain('button')
```

Ok, let's try to solve that exercise.

This is what you have to do.

Implement the following test cases:

* `Login button starts disabled`
* `Login button is kept disabled when filling only the email field`
* `Login button is kept disabled when filling only the password field`

> Run `npx protractor conf.js` to test that your implementation works

If all has gone well, you should see a result like this on your terminal.

```sh
[23:56:34] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver
[23:56:34] I/local - Starting selenium standalone server...

```

## Extra credit 1

The login page has some other behaviors that we could test.

If you try to login with a valid user but an invalid password, an alert is shown with an `Incorrect username or password.` message.

To deal with alerts using Protractor, we do it like this:

```js
const alertDialog = browser.switchTo().alert()

alertDialog.accept()
```

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ You could even run an assertion on the text of an alert (e.g., `expect(alertDialog.getText()).toEqual('Some text')`.)

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ Also, I suggest you look into [`waitForAlertToBePresent`](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper/blob/master/docs/EXAMPLES.md#waitforalerttobepresent) function, from `protractor-helper`.

**A big thanks to [Pedro Hyvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrohyvo/), for implenting this new function, which made into `protractor-helper`'s [4.2.0 release](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper/milestone/7?closed=1).**

Your turn. Implement a test that tries to login with a valid user, but an invalid password.

## Extra credit 2

Besides the previous scenario, there's another one.

If you try to login with an unnexistent user, a alert is shown with an `User does not exist.` message.

It's you again. Implement a test that tries to login with an invalid user.
