# Lesson 6 - Protecting sensitive information

It's a bad practice to commit credentials into a git repository.

To work this around, a simple solution is to export such sensitive information as environment variables, and make tests use them instead.

Here's how you export an environment variable for both Windows and Unix-based operating systems.

```sh
# Windows
$ set MY_SECRET_VARIABLE=<your variable value here>

# Unix
$ export MY_SECRET_VARIABLE=<your variable value here>
```

And here is how you read them with JavaScript

```js
process.env.MY_SECRET_VARIABLE
```

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ This technique is very useful when running tests on continuous integration systems. By the way, good CI systems/services usually provide a way to encrypt such data.

## Exercise

Refactor the `logs in successfully` test so that it reads the email and password from environment variables.

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ Don't forget to re-run the test to see if you haven't broken 💔 anything.
