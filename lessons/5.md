# Lesson 5 - Meet the [`protractor-helper`](https://wlsf82.github.io/protractor-helper/) library

`protractor-helper` is a library that I open-sourced in 2017, while working for [Whereby.com](https://whereby.com) (former appear.in), and I'm proud that today it's used by people all around the internet. ðŸ˜„

This library contains helper functions that can be used together with Protractor for creating robust end-to-end tests.

Many of the helper functions on this library use `protractor.ExpectedConditions` to ensure that the elements we want to interact with are in the correct state before interacting with them or running expectations (or assertions) on them. This helps in avoiding trying to interact with elements when they are not ready for it, which prevents test flakiness.

Well, since I'm the main maintainer of this library, I'll "steal" a bit more of its docs to show you the advantages of using it. (You can "steal" it too, I'm just kidding.)

## Basic example

Let's say you want to create a test for the sign in happy path of an example application.

### Example without using the protractor-helper module

Without this library, the test could be written as something like this:

```js
const EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions;
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_IN_MS = 5000;

describe("Sign in page", () => {
  it("successful sign in", () => {
    browser.get("https://example.com/sign-in");

    const emailField = element(by.id("email"));
    const passwordField = element(by.id("password"));
    const signinButton = element(by.id("signin"));

    browser.wait(EC.visibilityOf(emailField), DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_IN_MS);
    browser.wait(EC.visibilityOf(passwordField), DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_IN_MS);
    browser.wait(EC.elementToBeClickable(signinButton), DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_IN_MS);
    emailField.sendKeys("valid@email.com");
    passwordField.sendKeys("validpassword");
    signinButton.click();

    const avatar = element(by.id("avatar"));

    browser.wait(EC.visibilityOf(avatar), DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_IN_MS);

    expect(avatar.isDisplayed()).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Example using the protractor-helper module

The same test could be written as below, using the `protractor-helper` library.

```js
const helper = require("protractor-helper");

describe("Sign in page", () => {
  it("successful sign in", () => {
    browser.get("https://example.com/sign-up");

    const emailField = element(by.id("email"));
    const passwordField = element(by.id("password"));
    const signinButton = element(by.id("signin"));

    helper.fillFieldWithText(emailField, "valid@email.com");
    helper.fillFieldWithText(passwordField, "validpassword");
    helper.click(signinButton);

    const avatar = element(by.id("avatar"));

    helper.waitForElementVisibility(avatar);
  });
});
```

As you can see, by using the  `protractor-helper` library, the code is easier to read. Also, there is no need for unnecessary complexity.

## Exersice

Install the `protractor-helper` library (see https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper#installation.)

After that, refactor the existing test to use `protractor-helper` instead of using `protractor.ExpectedConditions` directly.

Finally, run the test until you make it pass, meaning that your refactor has worked (it changed the code structure without changing its behaviour.)

> From now on, we'll use `protractor-helper` whenever possible.

> Don't worry if you can't make it work straight away. Watch me doing it if you prefer.

You know what, I don't like having the user credentials hardcoded in the test file. Do you?
