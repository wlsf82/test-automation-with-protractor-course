# Lesson 16 - Tests demonstrations

Now that we have pretty good coverage of our app's main functionalities, it's time to make a demo to our team and stakeholders.

But these tests run too fast.

It would be cool to slow them down to look like real users using the app.

Meet the [`highlightDelay`](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/config.ts#L581) property of Protractor's config.

## Exercise

Update the `config/configCreator.js` file to use the `highlightDelay` property with the value of `1000` milliseconds.

> üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Remeber to unwrap the CRUD test from `Array(3).fill().map(() => {})`, and to make it back an `it()` instead of `fit()`.

Finally, run the tests (on Chrome or Firefox) and see what happens.

Did you notice? Besides slowing down every test action in one second, it also highlights the elements it's interacting with.

That's awesome, isn't it?

> Using such a technique, you could even narrate the tests as they run.
