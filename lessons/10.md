# Lesson 10 - Cross-browser testing

By default, Protractor runs tests against Chrome browser.

We've been doing that by executing the following command `npx protractor conf.js`.

> For a list of all Protractor supported browsers, visit http://www.protractortest.org/#/browser-support.

> In this course, we will only cover Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

To change the default browser where tests are run, we can pass the `--browser [browser-name]` to Protractor, and it will run the tests against it.

## Exercise

Run the login tests against Firefox.

If all went well, you should see a result like this.

```sh
[22:29:45] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver
[22:29:45] I/local - Starting selenium standalone server...
[22:29:46] I/local - Selenium standalone server started at http://192.168.178.17:59811/wd/hub
Started
......


6 specs, 0 failures
Finished in 11.038 seconds

[22:30:04] I/local - Shutting down selenium standalone server.
[22:30:04] I/launcher - 0 instance(s) of WebDriver still running
[22:30:04] I/launcher - firefox #01 passed
```

You see it? `firefox #01 passed`!
