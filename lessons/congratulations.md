That was quite a journey, hey?

I hope you liked going through this course as much as I liked teaching it to you.

Let's summarize all you've learned.

During the course of testing automation with Protractor, you learned:

* How to install and configure Protractor ✔️
* How to write tests for different scenarios of a non-angular web application ✔️
* How to focus on what's more important first ✔️
  * Most important features ✔️
  * Making it work first and refactoring later ✔️
* How to organize tests' pre-conditions ✔️
* How to protect sensitive information ✔️
* How to use a simplified version of the Page Objects pattern ✔️
* How to use other open-source libraries to help you write tests ✔️
* How to test file upload ✔️
* How to deal with alerts ✔️
* How to run cross-browser testing in both headful and headless modes ✔️
* How to improve the test report on the terminal for CI ✔️
* How to report test results as an HTML page ✔️
* A mechanism for re-running tests to prove they're not flakey ✔️

Now you're ready to put all this knowledge into practice.
