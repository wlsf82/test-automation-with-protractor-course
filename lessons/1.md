# Lesson 1 - Installation

[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org) is an open-source end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications (although I've used it to test other kinds of web apps, including non-angular ones), and it's available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor).

Since Protractor is used for testing, it should be installed as a dev dependency.

Dev dependencies are installed like so `npm install package-name --save-dev`, or, `npm i package-name -D`, for short. 😉

## Exercise

Inside the project's root directory, install `protractor` as a dev dependency.

> That was easy, wasn't it?

> 🕵️ To check that Protractor was correclty installed, run `npx protractor --version`. You should see a result like this `7.0.0`.
