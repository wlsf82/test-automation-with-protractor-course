# Lesson 3 - Creating a test file

In the previous lesson, we configured Protractor to look for tests files inside the `specs/` directory, and that tests should end with the `.spec.js` extension.

## Exercise

Create the `specs/` directory. Inside of it, add a file to test the **login** functionality of the app under test.

Another easy one, ha?
