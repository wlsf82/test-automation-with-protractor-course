# Lesson 7 - Increasing the test coverage

Different than unit tests (which should test only one thing at a time), end-to-end tests can (sometimes) test more than one thing on the same `it` block (if they are somehow related).

It might cost more (in terms of execution time) to run two tests instead of only one, if they are testing something that is related.

We can say that the login and logout functionalities are somehow related, and so, what about testing them together?

## Exercise

Update the `logs in successfully` test to be `logs in and out successfully`.

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ After the existing assertion (`helper.waitForElementVisibility(yourNotesHeading)`), you will have to click on the Logout button and assert that you were correctly redirected to the `/login` page.

> For the new assertion, I suggest that you look into the available [`protractor-helper`](https://wlsf82.github.io/protractor-helper/) functions. [One of them](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper/blob/master/docs/EXAMPLES.md#waitforurltobeequaltoexpectedurl) might be exactly what you're looking for. 😉

> 🧙🏻 Finally, by testing login together with logout, you're making sure this test won't affect the next ones, that might need the user to be logged out.

Talking about next tests, move on to [lesson 8](./8.md) to test some alternate paths of the login page.
