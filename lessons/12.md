# Lesson 12 - Improving the test report on terminal

Test results matter, and if  they show us useful information, that's great!

Meet [jasmine-spec-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-spec-reporter). 🤝

With `jasmine-spec-reporter`, instead of test results looking like this:

```sh
protractor config/chromeHeadless.conf.js

[22:56:22] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver
[22:56:22] I/local - Starting selenium standalone server...
[22:56:23] I/local - Selenium standalone server started at http://192.168.178.17:62111/wd/hub
Started
......


6 specs, 0 failures
Finished in 8.484 seconds

[22:56:33] I/local - Shutting down selenium standalone server.
[22:56:33] I/launcher - 0 instance(s) of WebDriver still running
[22:56:33] I/launcher - chrome #01 passed
```

They will look like this:

```sh
protractor config/chromeHeadless.conf.js

[23:00:00] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver
[23:00:00] I/local - Starting selenium standalone server...
[23:00:01] I/local - Selenium standalone server started at http://192.168.178.17:64754/wd/hub

Much better, isn't it?

And the best part is that it doesn't require much (in terms of code) to having these informative test results. See how it would look like at Protractor's configuration file.

```js
module.exports.config = {
  // rest of the code ...
  onPrepare: () => {
    // rest of the code ...
    jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new SpecReporter({
      displayFailuresSummary: true,
      displayFailedSpec: true,
      displaySuiteNumber: true,
      displaySpecDuration: true
    }))
  }
}
```

That's it.

## Exercise

1. Install `jasmine-spec-reporter` as a dev dependency
2. Configure Protractor to use it

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ You just need to change the `configCreator.js` file.

Run the tests to see this pretty test output!

Much better, ha?

What if we could also have an HTML test report.

As a matter of fact, we can.

Move on to [lesson 13](./13.md) to learn just that.
