# Lesson 15 - A mechanism to ensure your tests are flakiness-free

Have you already heard of flaky tests?

Flaky tests are those which pass in the first run but fail on the second (and vice-versa) without any code change.

One day I was reading a newsletter about JavaScript from [ui.dev](https://ui.dev), and I learned something that could be used to test if my tests are robust enough.

The idea is that I'd be able to say, run this test N times, and if it passes on all runs, I could consider it a robust test.

The implementation goes like this:

```js
Array(3).fill().map(() => {
  doSomething()
})
```

**IMPORTANT: During the course, do not use this mechanism with numbers higher than 3, please.**

> If a test passes three times in a row, you did a great job, and your test is flakiness-free.

## Excercise

Wrap the `successfully CRUD a note` test between `Array(3).fill().map(() => {})`, run it in headless mode (on Chrome or Firefox), and see if the test pass on all runs.

> 🕵🏻‍♀️ The code should look like this.

```js
// specs/crud.spec.js

// rest of the code ...

describe('CRUD operations', () => {
  // rest of the code ...

  Array(3).fill().map(() => {
    fit('successfully CRUD a note', () => {
      // rest of the code ...
    })
  })
})
```

By the end of the test execution, you should see a result like this:

```sh
protractor config/chromeHeadless.conf.js

As you may have noticed, our test passed three times. ✅

> Notice that the login tests have been skipped. This is because we're prefixing the CRUD test with an `f` (instead of `it()`, we're using `fit()`). This runs only that test. 💡

Demo time!
