# Pre-requirements

Before we start, you need to be aware of the requirements for writing automated tests with Protractor.

Protractor can be used on both Windows and Unix-based operating systems (e.g., Linux and Mac OS).

Independent of the operating system, you will need:

* [git](https://git-scm.com) (I'm using version `2.26.2` while writing this lesson)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I'm using version `v14.15.4` while writing this lesson)
* NPM (I'm using version `6.14.11` while writing this lesson)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (I'm using version `88.0.4324.96 (Official Build) (x86_64)` while writing this lesson)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (I'm using version `84.0.2 (64-bit)` while writing this lesson)

> **Note:** I recommend that you use the same or greater versions of the above-mentioned systems.

> **Note 2:** When installing Node.js, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is automatically installed, so you don't need to do it yourself.

> **Note 3:** To check which versions of git, Node.js and NPM you're using, run `git --version && node --version && npm --version` on your terminal.

> **Note 4:** I left links to find the downloads of all requirements on the above-list.

## Create a directory for your coding adventure!

On your computer, create a directory that will be used especifically for this course, and call it `test-automation-with-protractor/`.

## Initalizing git and npm

Access the just created directory (e.g., `cd test-automation-with-protractor/`) and run `npm init -y && git init`.

### .gitignore file

In the next lesson, we'll install Protractor as a dev dependency of our project (which means that a `node_modules` directory will be created.) We don't want git to track files inside of the `node_modules/` directory.

So, inside of the project's root directory, create a file called `.gitignore` (e.g., `touch .gitignore`), and add the following lines inside of it.

```.gitignore
.DS_Store
node_modules/

```
> Sometimes Mac computers automatically create a `.DS_Store` file when using NPM. This is why we're adding it to `.gitignore` too.

You've made it! 👍
